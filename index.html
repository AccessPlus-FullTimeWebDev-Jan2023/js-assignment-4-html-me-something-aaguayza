                   <p>High Grade is the most commonly made model grade.</p>
                   <p>This grade is most suited for beginners as it is easy to build, more adffordable ($12-25$), and are small so you can collect a bunch!</p>

                   <p>Master Grades are larger and more detailed than High Grade.</p>
                   <p>The process to build may take a little longer but the size, detail, and posability of these kits make the whole journey worth it!</p>

                   <p>These kits have the detail and complexity of master grades but in the size of a High Grade!</p>
                   <p>While the parts are smaller, this is still a fun model grade to work with!  This is a great choice if you want to collect what can be seen as mini Master Grades</p>

                   <p>Perfect grades are HUGE compared to the other grades.  They come with more parts, detal, and even feture LED lights to give that sense of realism!</p>
                   <p>While this is the most expensive of the grades ($200+), they are still a great experience for beginners.  These kits are also perfect for a group build since there are so many parts!</p>
